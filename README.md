# PenPals

### The basic purpose
> Pen pals are people who regularly write to each other, particularly via postal mail.
> Pen pals are usually strangers whose relationship is based primarily, or even solely, on their exchange of letters.

Having pen pal friendships is no longer as common as it once was.
The idea of this app is to make it easier for people to find pen pals with common interests to interact with and keep alive the somewhat vintage vibe of conversing
with a pen-pal.
This app can help people learn a new language and also learn about the culture of a new city/country by conversing with a native of that place.

### How does it work?
Every user on signing up enters the language they want to learn from their pen-pal and also their native language.
> Suppose User A speaks English natively and would like to perfect their French, and User B speaks French natively and wants to learn English,
> the app would match the two of them and encourage them to speak in each others language.
